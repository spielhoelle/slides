# Data Visualization Essentials


# Introduction to Data Visualization

- Importance of Visualizing Data
- Tools Overview: Matplotlib and Seaborn

Speaker Notes:

- Emphasize the significance of visual data representation in making data comprehensible.
- Introduce Matplotlib and Seaborn as two of Python's primary libraries for statistical graphics and visualizations.



# Getting Started with Matplotlib


### Basic Plotting

- Creating a Simple Line Plot
- Overview of Different Types of Plots: Line Plot, Bar Chart, Histogram

Speaker Notes:

- Demonstrate creating a simple line plot using `plt.plot()`.
- Explain the different types of plots in Matplotlib:
	- Line plots for trends and relationships between variables.
	- Bar charts for comparative data and categorical analysis.
	- Histograms for frequency distribution and data density.


### Practical Exercise: Creating Basic Plots

- Line Plot Example: `plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 4, 9, 16, 25])`
- Bar Chart Example: `plt.bar(['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Cherries'], [12, 15, 7])`
- Histogram Example: `plt.hist(data, bins=10)`



# Introduction to Seaborn

- Why Seaborn over Matplotlib?
- High-Level Interface for Statistical Plots

Speaker Notes:

- Discuss Seaborn's advantages:
	- Built-in themes and color palettes.
	- Ability to handle Pandas data structures directly.
- Emphasize Seaborn's capabilities for making complex statistical plots more accessible.


# Seaborn Plot Types


### Scatter Plots, Box Plots, and Heatmaps

- Scatter Plot: `sns.scatterplot(x='height', y='weight', data=df)`
- Box Plot: `sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)`
- Heatmap: `sns.heatmap(data.corr())`

Speaker Notes:

- Explain when to use each type of plot:
	- Scatter plots for relationships between variables.
	- Box plots for distributions with respect to categories.
	- Heatmaps for data intensity and correlation matrices.



# Combining Plots and Customizing Graphics


### Overlaying Plots and Customizing with Matplotlib and Seaborn

- Combine a line plot and bar chart
- Apply a theme and customize the legend and labels

Speaker Notes:

- Show how to overlay plots using `plt.plot()` and `sns.barplot()`.
- Discuss how to customize plots with:
	- Labels: `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`
	- Legends: `plt.legend()`
	- Themes: `sns.set_style()`


### Practical Exercise: Customizing and Combining Plots

- Combine a line plot and bar chart
- Apply a theme and customize the legend and labels



# Q&A and Review of Data Visualization

- Open floor for questions
- Review essential visualization concepts and tools

Speaker Notes:

- Address any questions the students might have.
- Recap key points from the visualization segment, emphasizing the practical applications of Matplotlib and Seaborn in real-world data analysis.
