# Welcome to Big Data!
## Discovering the Universe of Large Scale Data

Speaker Notes:

- Welcome participants to the workshop.
- Briefly introduce the day’s agenda and the objective to understand what big data is and how it is used today.

# What is Big Data?
- [Scary](https://www.hownormalami.eu/)
- **Volume:** Immense amounts of data
- **Velocity:** Generated at high speeds
- **Variety:** Different types of data

Speaker Notes:

- Explain the three V's of big data: Volume, Velocity, and Variety.
- Use an example like social media platforms generating large amounts of data every second.


## Volume

- **Example:** Facebook generates 4 petabytes of data daily
- **Challenge:** Storing and processing this data
- **Solution:** Distributed storage and processing systems


## Velocity

- **Example:** Twitter generates 500 million tweets daily
- **Challenge:** Processing data in real-time
- **Solution:** Stream processing systems


## Variety

- **Example:** Data from social media, sensors, logs, etc.
- **Challenge:** Handling different data types
- **Solution:** Flexible data models and storage systems



# Everyday Examples of Big Data
- Social Media Statistics
- Online Shopping Patterns
- Smart Home Devices

Speaker Notes:

- Illustrate with examples: Mention how every like, comment, and share on social media adds to big data.
- Discuss how online shopping records every purchase and customer preference.


## Exercise
- Explore huggingface datasets

  - [openbmb/UltraInteract_sft](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraInteract_sft)

Speaker Notes:

- Empathize the dataset viewer



# Hands-On 

## Icecream revenue prediction


# **Exercise**: 
Explore [this](/IceCreamData.csv) data set on your own


# **Solution**: 
See and explain on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tariquepce/ice-cream-revenue-prediction/input)



# Time for a Short Break!
## Any questions?
Otherwise ... see you in 15 minutes

Speaker Notes:

- Encourage participants to stretch and refresh themselves.
- Invite questions or discussions informally during the break.



# Understanding Data Types and Sources
- Structured vs Unstructured Data
- Examples from daily life

Speaker Notes:

- Explain the difference between structured and unstructured data with examples like a formatted database vs. videos and images.


## Structured Data

- **Definition:** Data with a clear format and organization
- **Examples:** Relational databases, spreadsheets
- **Characteristics:** Easy to analyze and process
- **Challenge:** Limited flexibility and horizontal scalability


## Unstructured Data

- **Definition:** Data without a predefined format
- **Examples:** Videos, images, social media posts
- **Characteristics:** Difficult to analyze and process
- **Challenge:** Extracting meaningful insights


## Examples:

- **MySQL** 
- **MongoDB**



# Data Types wtf?
## Comparing Ingredients in Cooking
- Structured: Recipe ingredients
- Unstructured: Cooking style

Speaker Notes:

- Use the cooking analogy to make the concept more relatable.
- Discuss how structured ingredients follow a recipe, whereas unstructured cooking styles vary.


# **Integers**:
## Counting Apples
- Analogy: Just like integers are used for whole numbers in programming, think of counting apples. You can have 1, 2, 3 apples, but never a fraction of an apple when you are counting.
- Real-life Use: Integers are used in real life for counting discrete items, like counting people in a room, pages in a book, or buildings on a street.


# **Floats**:
## Measuring Ingredients
- Analogy: Floating point numbers allow for fractions, similar to measuring ingredients in cooking. For example, you might need 1.5 cups of flour or 0.75 teaspoon of salt.
- Real-life Use: Floats are useful whenever precise measurements are needed, such as in cooking, carpentry, or scientific experiments where partial quantities are involved.


# **Strings**:
## Naming Pets
- Analogy: Strings in programming are sequences of characters used for text. Comparatively, think of naming pets where each name is a sequence of characters, like "Bella", "Charlie", or "Max".
- Real-life Use: Strings are used for names, addresses, and essentially any data that can be represented in text form.


# **Boolean**:
## Light Switch
- Analogy: A Boolean type has two possible values: true or false. This is like a light switch, which can only be either on or off.
- Real-life Use: Booleans are used in real life for decisions that have a binary outcome, such as determining if a store is open or closed, or if a device is turned on or off.


# **Arrays**:
## Grocery List
- Analogy: An array in programming stores multiple items of the same type. Think of it like a grocery list, where you list multiple items (all groceries) you need to buy: milk, eggs, bread, etc.
- Real-life Use: Arrays reflect any collection of similar items, such as a to-do list, a collection of books, or a lineup of players on a sports team.


# **Objects**:
## Personal Information
- Analogy: In programming, an object is a collection of properties that are related, much like a person’s wallet which might contain various cards (credit card, ID, library card) each with specific attributes.
- Real-life Use: Objects are mirrored in the way we organize information in real life, such as a recipe (ingredients, steps, cooking time), a car (make, model, color), or personal information (name, address, phone number).



# Lunch Break
### Coming up:
