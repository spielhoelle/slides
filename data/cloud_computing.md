# Introduction to Data Visualization
- Importance of Visualizing Data
- Tools Overview: Matplotlib and Seaborn

Speaker Notes:

- Explain the significance of visual data representation in making data comprehensible.
- Briefly introduce Matplotlib and Seaborn as two of Python's primary libraries for statistical graphics and visualizations.


# Just for fun

- Look at [D3.js](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery?utm_source=d3js-org&utm_medium=nav&utm_campaign=try-observable)


# Getting Started with Matplotlib
- Basic Plotting
- Plot Types: Line Plot, Bar Chart, Histogram

Speaker Notes:

- Demonstrate creating a simple line plot.
- Overview of different types of plots in Matplotlib: line plots for trends, bar charts for comparative data, and histograms for frequency distribution.


# Practical Exercise: 
## Creating Basic Plots
- Line Plot Example
- Bar Chart Example
- Histogram Example

Speaker Notes:

- Provide code snippets and datasets:
    - Line Plot: plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 4, 9, 16, 25])
    - Bar Chart: plt.bar(['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Cherries'], [12, 15, 7])
    - Histogram: plt.hist(data, bins=10)


# Introduction to Seaborn
- Why Seaborn over Matplotlib?
- High-Level Interface for Statistical Plots

Speaker Notes:

- Discuss Seaborn's advantages: built-in themes, color palettes, and its ability to handle Pandas data structures directly.
- Emphasize Seaborn's capabilities for making complex statistical plots more accessible.


# Seaborn Plot Types
- Scatter Plots
- Box Plots
- Heatmaps

Speaker Notes:

- Explain when to use scatter plots (relationships between variables), box plots (distributions with respect to categories), and heatmaps (data intensity).


# Advanced Seaborn
- Scatter Plot: 
  - `sns.scatterplot(x='height', y='weight', data=df)`
- Box Plot: `sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)`
- Heatmap: `sns.heatmap(data.corr())`

Speaker Notes:

- Provide code snippets and encourage students to try visualizing different datasets:
    - Scatter Plot: Use to analyze the relationship between two variables.
    - Box Plot: Great for seeing statistical summaries and outliers.
    - Heatmap: Useful for visualizing the correlation matrix of multiple variables.


# Combining Plots and Customizing Graphics
- Overlaying Plots
- Customizing with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Speaker Notes:

- Show how to overlay plots, such as a line plot on a bar chart for dual-axis visualizations.
- Discuss how to customize plots with labels, legends, and themes for better presentation quality.


# Practical Exercise: 
## Customizing and Combining Plots
- Combine a line plot and bar chart
- Apply a theme and customize the legend and labels

Speaker Notes:

- Guide students through an example of combining plot types.
- Teach how to apply themes and customize plot aspects to enhance readability and aesthetics.


# Q&A and Review of Data Visualization
- Open floor for questions
- Review essential visualization concepts and tools

Speaker Notes:

- Address any questions the students might have.
- Recap key points from the visualization segment, emphasizing the practical applications of Matplotlib and Seaborn in real-world data analysis.
