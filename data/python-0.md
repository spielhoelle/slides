# Python Basics
- Create a [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Overview of Data Types
- Basic Control Structures
- Introduction to Functions

Speaker Notes:

- Quick overview of previous session
- Touch on data types, loops, conditionals


# Python Data Types
- Integers
- Floats
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets

Speaker Notes:

- Explain each type with examples
- Mention mutable vs immutable types


# Control Structures in Python
- Conditionals (if, elif, else)
- Conditional Operators (and, or, not)

Speaker Notes:

- conditionals control
- looping over data structures
- logical operators to combine conditions


# Loops (for, while) 
- for, while
- iterator variants: range, enumerate
- break and continue
- array indexing
- nesting loops and big O notation

Speaker Notes:

- Go has one loops
- Javascript has 20


# "Exercise" 
## Crash your browser with an infinite loops

```
while (true) {
    console.log(Date.now())
}
```


# Introduction to Functions
- Why use functions?
- Defining a function
- Function parameters and arguments

Speaker Notes:

- functions for reusability and organization


# Functions Continued
- Default parameter values
- Keyword and positional arguments
- Return values

Speaker Notes:

- default values
- return values


# Combining Concepts
- Using loops with conditionals
- Functions calling other functions
- Mixing data types in lists and functions

Speaker Notes:

- function that filters and processes list items
- integrate loops, conditionals, and functions
- heterogeneous lists


# Practical Exercise: 
## Integrating Python Concepts
- Create a function that processes a list using loops and conditionals
- Implement a small project using all learned concepts

Speaker Notes:

- Guide the creation of a comprehensive function
- Encourage experimentation with combining different elements


# Q&A and Troubleshooting
- Open floor for questions
- Review complex examples
- Address any confusion from today's topics

Speaker Notes:

- Answer specific questions from students
- Revisit any difficult concepts
- Provide additional examples where needed
