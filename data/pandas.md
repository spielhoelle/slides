# Introduction to Pandas

- What is Pandas?
- Why use Pandas in data analysis?

Speaker Notes:

- Explain Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool developed on top of the Python programming language.
- Highlight its role in data analysis for its simplicity and powerful data handling capabilities.


# Datascience terms

- [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Interpretation_and_application)
- [Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)
- [Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)

# Pandas Data Structures
- Series
- DataFrames

Speaker Notes:

- Describe Series as one-dimensional arrays with any data type.
- Introduce DataFrame as a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data.


# Creating and Loading Data
- Creating DataFrames manually
- Loading data from files (CSV, Excel)

Speaker Notes:

- Show how to create DataFrames from lists and dicts.
- Demonstrate loading data from various file formats into DataFrames.


# Basic Operations with Pandas
- Viewing and selecting data
- Filtering data
- Adding and deleting columns

Speaker Notes:

- Teach how to view portions of data using head() and tail().
- Explain selecting specific columns or rows using indexing and slicing.
- Cover filtering data based on conditions.
- Show how to add new columns or delete existing ones in a DataFrame.


# Data Manipulation Techniques
- Applying functions to data
- Handling missing data
- Merging and joining DataFrames

Speaker Notes:

- Discuss applying custom or built-in functions to DataFrame columns.
- Explain strategies for dealing with missing data (e.g., fillna, dropna).
- Teach merging and joining techniques to combine multiple DataFrames.


# Grouping and Aggregating Data
- Group by operations
- Aggregate functions
- Pivot tables
- [Examples](https://chat.openai.com/share/f002495f-8ce6-4739-96fa-baccffede941)

Speaker Notes:

- Illustrate how to use groupby for grouping data based on some criteria.
- Explain using aggregate functions like sum, mean, and max.
- Show how to create pivot tables for data summarization.


# Practical Exercise: 
## Data Analysis with Pandas
- Analyze a real-world dataset using Pandas
- Perform data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization

Speaker Notes:

- Provide a dataset for students to practice on.
- Guide them through cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing data using Pandas.
